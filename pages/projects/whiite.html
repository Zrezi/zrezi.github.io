					<h3 id="name">whiite linux</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						Whiite Linux is an old version of a specific Linux distribution that was ported to run on the
						PowerPC architecture, which is the architecture of the CPU that is in the Wii. Granted, the Wii is
						very minimal in terms of computer performace, but I believe the distribution was created as a proof
						of concept &mdash; that Linux could be run on the Wii. It took about a week of diving deep into
						old forum posts when the (albeit very good) tutorial to install Whiite failed. There were many
						<i>random</i> errors that had little to no documentation. This page is a guide for installing this
						version of Linux on your Wii with hopefully as little trouble as possible.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h5>before we begin</h5>
					<p>
						Keep in mind that the Wii is a pathetic computer in the realm of things. Whiite does not even come with
						a graphical interface &mdash; everything is in command line. If the terminal scares you, run far away.
						Furthermore, do not expect to run anything spectacular on the machine. If you want to install Whiite for
						the novelty of running Linux on a Wii, that's perfect. If you plan is to write a high performance webserver
						in C and use the Wii as your personal hosting machine...think again.
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<h5>disclaimer</h5>
					<p>
						I think this is pretty self-explanatory. You are deliberately messing with the Wii's operating system. If
						something "goes wrong" in the installation process, you might brick your Wii and render it useless. <b>This
						is your warning</b>. If you choose to continue I am not responsible for anything that happens to your Wii or
						your computer.
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<h5>requirements</h5>
					<p>
						In order to install Whiite you're going to need a few things.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">At least 2 hours</li>
						<li class="collection-item">2GB SD card</li>
						<li class="collection-item">512MB or larger USB flash drive</li>
						<li class="collection-item">USB keyboard</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Computer with -nix installed. A Virtual Machine should work fine if you're on Windows</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Internet-connected Wii</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Wiimote</li>
						<li class="collection-item">TV</li>
						<li class="collection-item">You're not scared of the terminal</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Ability to follow directions</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>technical specs</h5>
					<p>
						Like I've said already, the Wii has pretty poor specs. Don't expect to run anything intensive.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Broadway 750CL 729.00MHz Processor</li>
						<li class="collection-item">76204kB of RAM</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Mitsumi DWM-W004 WiFi 802.11b/g<br><i>My average tested speeds on a 20Mbit connection were ~160kB/s</i></li>
						<li class="collection-item">18W active power consumption</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<hr>
					<h3>getting whiite</h3>
					<p>
						If you're here that means you actually want to install Whiite on your Wii. That's cool.
						The next steps will walk you through how to get your Wii ready for Whiite, and take you step by step
						through the installation process. The entire thing probably takes ~1 hour if nothing goes wrong.
						Could be quicker too if you can read fast! That reminds me, <b>don't skip steps</b>. If a step is
						done out of order it will probably cause the installation to fail, and waste your time. Alright, onwards.
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<h5>updating your wii to 4.3</h5>
					<p>
						If you know how to update your Wii, or are already on 4.3, you can skip this step.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Start up your Wii, and navigate to the Settings</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Choose the right option, "Wii System Settings"</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Scroll right through the options until you find Internet</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Make sure that your Wii is connected to the internet via a wireless connection by either selecting a previous connection option, or by setting up a new connection point</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Once you have working WiFi, return to the system settings and choose "Wii System Update" (it's on the third page of options)</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Wait for the Wii to update. This may take upwards of 10 minutes depending on your internet connection speed</li>
						<li class="collection-item">After it updates, it should reboot by itself (I think), and return to the main Wii Menu</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Confirm the update was successful by going back to "Wii System Settings", and in the top right of the menu you should see "Wii System 4.3X", where X is your Wii System country's version</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>installing homebrew</h5>
					<p>
						Before you install Homebrew, you <i>need</i> to make sure your Wii is upgraded to 4.3. Installing homebrew
						is a somewhat lengthy process itself, and there are countless YouTube tutorials and guides out there. I'd
						go ahead and follow <a id="link-homebrew" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Homebrew-on-Wii-Menu-4.3">this</a>, but <b>DO NOT
						INSTALL BOOTMII YET</b>.
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<h5>installing ios236</h5>
					<p>
						This step reverts the Wii's native operating system to an earlier version, the one that allows us to take
						advantage of a system exploit and write to the Wii's NAND memory.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Download this broken link, and place it in the apps folder on your SD card</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Navigate back to the Homebrew Channel, and run the installer. Choose the first option when it loads, and wait for it to complete</li>
						<li class="collection-item">As soon as it's done, you can exit the app and restart the Wii</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Once restarted, move onto the next step</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>installing bootmii as boot2</h5>
					<p>
						Now that IOS236 has been successfully installed, we'll take advantage of that exploit I mentioned.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Go back to the Hackmii bundled installer in your Wii's message board (Letterbomb)</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Run it, and wait for it to load again</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Press (1) on the Wiimote, or (A) if you're using a gamecube controller to continue pass the loading screen</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Choose these options as they appear
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item"><code>Install Bootmii</code></li>
								<li class="collection-item"><code>Install as boot2</code></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Confirm the installation, and you should see some information about NAND memory being written to. This means that it worked</li>
						<li class="collection-item">If you are unable to install Bootmii at all, that probably means that you didn't do the previous step which was to install IOS236. Make sure you've done that step and then try again</li>
						<li class="collection-item">After the installation completes, you can exit the bundled installer and move on to setting up the SD card and the USB drive</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5 style="background-color: red;">setting up the sd card and usb</h5>
					<p>
						This is the only part that isn't done....I'll get around to finishing it. The Whiite tutorial actually
						does a decent job at explaining this section of the install.
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<h5>run the whiite installer</h5>
					<p>
						We will be using the installer for the <i>sole purpose</i> of how it partitions your SD card. I have been unsuccessful in trying to manually partition the SD card, even when it matches the layout of how the installer does it.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Boot the Wii with the SD, USB drive, and USB keyboard plugged in. Navigate to the Homebrew Channel, and run the gc-whiite installer app</li>
						<li class="collection-item">A couple menus will appear. Using the keyboard, you're always going to want to say &lt;yes&gt; when presented with that option</li>
						<li class="collection-item">
							Eventually, it will start to install. Using the recommended 2GB SD card, this process will take ~15 minutes. Do NOT unplug anything or turn off your Wii during this time
							<br><br><i>When the menu appears about "creating the journal", if it appears to freeze that is normal. For some reason this step takes a bit longer than all of the previous steps while installing</i>
							<br><br><i>I tried using a 16GB card, and shut down my Wii after an hour of waiting. Just food for thought.</i>
						</li>
						<li class="collection-item">When the process completes, it will prompt you to press enter and restart the system. Do this. It won't restart, or it might. Once it turns completely off or you turn it off, move on to the next step</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>wipe the sd card</h5>
					<p>
						Remember I said that we're only using the installer for the way that it partitions the SD card, nothing else.
						So if it seems weird that you're deleting the thing you just technically installed, the point of the installation
						was to partition is in a correct way.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Unplug the SD card from your Wii, and reconnect it to your computer</li>
						<li class="collection-item">When plugged in, you should find that two separate partitions have been created by the installer
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item">boot</li>
								<li class="collection-item">whiite</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Using terminal, the path to the mounted partitions should be something like "/media/$USER/boot/" and "/media/$USER/whiite/"</li>
						<li class="collection-item">We need to remove all files on both partitions. Using the terminal, run:
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item"><code>rm -rf /media/$USER/boot/*</code></li>
								<li class="collection-item"><code>rm -rf /media/$USER/whiite/*</code></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="collection-item">
							Confirm that the files have been removed by either <code>ls</code>'ing in terminal, or navigating to the partitions with your file manager
							<br><br><i>Note: When unplugging the SD card from your computer, make sure to eject it safely. For me, when performing copy and deletes from the SD from my computer, the terminal commands would end but the SD card would still be performing actions. If you do not eject safely, you risk corrupting the filesystem or the kernel</i>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>add bootmii</h5>
					<p>
						Now you can copy over the bootmii app boot files. We will be replacing ppcboot.elf however, so we will delete that.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Remember the folder you copied from your SD card when you initially installed bootmii? Copy that entire folder into the SD card's boot partition</li>
						<li class="collection-item">We will be overwriting the ppcboot.elf file in the bootmii folder, so we can delete it first via terminal:
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item"><code>rm /media/$USER/boot/bootmii/ppcboot.elf</code></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>getting the correct kernel</h5>
					<p>
						We want the latest, most updated version of the Whiite kernel. Since bootmii is now reinstalled on the partitioned
						SD card, we can grab the kernel and copy that over as well.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">The filestructure of the SD card should look like this:
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item">boot <i>(partition)</i>
									<ul class="collection">
										<li class="collection-item">bootmii
											<ul class="collection">
												<li class="collection-item">armboot.bin</li>
												<li class="collection-item">bootmii.ini</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li class="collection-item">whiite <i>(partition)</i></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Go to <a id="link-kernel-image" href="http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/WL:whiite-linux#Featured_kernel_images">this</a> website and download the kernel version that best fits your TV and Wii setup. I would say 99 out of 100 times you're going to want to use the 5<sup>th</sup> option, "<a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gc-linux/mikep5-zImage-2.6.32.mini.480p(NTSC).elf">mikep5-zImage-2.6.32.mini.480p(NTSC).elf</a>"</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Move the .elf file into the bootmii folder on your SD card, either with the <code>mv</code> terminal command or by dragging and dropping the file</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Rename the file "ppcboot.elf"
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item"><code>mv /media/$USER/boot/bootmii/mikep5-zImage-2.6.32.mini.480p(NTSC).elf /media/$USER/boot/bootmii/ppcboot.elf</code></li>
							</ul>... taking the place of the bootmii ppcboot.elf generated file that you deleted earlier!
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>updated filesystem</h5>
					<p>
						Now that we have the kernel and the bootloader (which is bootmii) installed, we can install the filesystem.
						We want to get the latest version, but it's still been 8 years since a new version has come out.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Download <a id="link-filesystem" href="http://downloads.sf.net/gc-linux/debian-lenny-5.0%2Bwhiite-1.10.tar.bz2">this</a> file</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Navigate to the whiite directory on your SD card
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item"><code>cd /media/$USER/whiite</code></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Untar the downloaded file into this location using the terminal
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item nested-li"><code>sudo tar -xjvf /home/$USER/Downloads/debian-lenny-5.0+whiite-1.10.tar.bz2</code></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Wait for the untarring process to finish, it may take ~10 seconds to complete</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Eject the drive safely, and wait for confirmation that you're able to unplug before you do so. Again, not safely removing the SD card from your computer risks corruption of the filesystem</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<hr>
					<h3>once whiite is installed</h3>
					<p>
						Alright, so you should'nt've (that's a legit word) turned the Wii on since all of the filesystem and kernel copying.
						Everything should be copied over to the SD card, no errors should've come up, etc. etc.
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<h5>booting for the first time</h5>
					<p>
						This is really the easiest step. Just turn it on and login.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Make sure that the SD card is in the Wii</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Turn on the Wii</li>
						<li class="collection-item">You should see a black background with white text scrolling fairly fast. Wait for it to stop.</li>
						<li class="collection-item">It shouldn't crash. If so, your best bet is to Google the generic error(s), not specifying the Wii</li>
						<li class="collection-item">When prompted (a.k.a. when the text stops scrolling), enter whiite's default login information:
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item">Login: <code>root</code></li>
								<li class="collection-item">Password: <code>whiite</code></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="collection-item">You should now be logged into whiite on your Wii as root</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>fixing the keyboard</h5>
					<p>
						For some reason the default keyboard layout is in Spanish. Weird.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">If you try typing some symbols, such as '-', you can see that they don't display the correct characters</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Run the command <code>dpkg-reconfigure console-data</code>. To type the dash, use the numberpad '-' character. That one works.</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Wait for the configuration tool to load...</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Choose these options as they appear to load a standard QWERTY English keyboard
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item">OK</li>
								<li class="collection-item">Select keymap from full list</li>
								<li class="collection-item"><i>Scroll down with the arrow keys until you find "pc / qwerty / US american / Standard / Standard"</i></li>
								<li class="collection-item"><i>Press enter for that choice</i></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Wait for the tool to finish working...</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Now your keyboard should be set up properly</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>setting up wifi</h5>
					<p>
						WiFi is the most finicky part of the entire installation. If this part doesn't work for you, I most likely have
						no idea why. Either get Googling or reinstall (but reinstalling probably won't fix it...I tried).
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Whiite comes bundled with an easy installer that automatically modifies the "/etc/network/interfaces" file, aptly called Whiite-ez-wifi-config</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Navigate to root, <code>cd ~</code></li>
						<li class="collection-item">Run <code>./whiite-ez-wifi-config</code></li>
						<li class="collection-item">Follow the onscreen prompts to enter your network SSID and passkey</li>
						<li class="collection-item">There will be an option to test your connection. TEST THE CONNECTION. If it doesn't work, don't worry. It might've worked anyway and the test is wrong.</li>
						<li class="collection-item">Exit the installer. Back in the terminal, you can run <code>iwconfig</code> to see if you're connected to a network</li>
						<li class="collection-item">You'll be looking for the wlan0 connection. If you can't connect to WiFi still, you can manually check the file by running <code>vi /etc/network/interfaces</code>. You can also restart at this time, that might help: <code>shutdown -h now</code></li>
						<li class="collection-item">If everything looks like it's working, <code>ping</code> a website like Google and hopefully you'll see some action</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>getting correct aptitude repositories</h5>
					<p>
						Since the version of Linux that Whiite is based on (Debian Lenny) is from nearly a decade ago, the respository paths for Aptitude
						are obviously broken. Luckily there's an easy fix.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">Debian Lenny is now unsupported, so any <code>apt-get install</code> will fail due to the wrong repository source being used</li>
						<li class="collection-item">To update this, use the following commands in order:
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item"><code>deb http://archive.debian.org/debian/ lenny contrib main non-free</code></li>
								<li class="collection-item"><code>deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-security lenny/updates main</code></li>
								<li class="collection-item"><code>apt-get install debian-archive-keyring</code></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>upgrade and update aptitude</h5>
					<p>
						If you got this far, I probably don't need to show you how to upgrade/update apt.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item"><s>Overall I think it was ~150MB</s> I have no idea how much it was to upgrade and update everything
							<ul class="collection">
								<li class="collection-item"><code>apt-get update</code></li>
								<li class="collection-item"><code>apt-get upgrade</code></li>
								<li class="collection-item"><code>apt-get update</code></li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<h5>trying apt</h5>
					<p>
						If the previous step didn't fail, then you're all set up. You can't do much with the Wii, but you
						can look at htop. Speaking of, you can download that.
					</p>
					<ul class="collection">
						<li class="collection-item">htop is essentially a better version of top, which is your basic System Monitor</li>
						<li class="collection-item"><code>apt-get install htop</code></li>
						<li class="collection-item">Likewise, Debian Lenny comes with the Vi text editor. However, if you're planning to do any text editing at all just get Vim.</li>
						<li class="collection-item"><code>apt-get install vim</code></li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
					<hr>
					<h3>finished</h3>
					<p>
						If you're here, you either skipped to the bottom to see what the last few steps were or if you have
						legitimately gotten to this point, you should have a Wii with 100% working Linux. <s>It's fast, it's
						pretty, and</s> it's pretty cool.
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<h3>help</h3>
					<p>
						Honestly, there's so many little things that could go wrong during this process, and usually even a minor
						one will render the kernel or the filesystem unusable, <i>especially</i> not letting your computer copy
						all of the files over correct. I've installed Whiite on 2 Wiis, and they each had their own individual
						problems and complications.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you run into an issue that you can't figure out, I'd recommend just completely wiping the SD card and
						the USB drive, and starting from scratch. If it locks up at the same step twice, try it a third time and if
						it still doesn't work then contact me <a id="link-contactme" href="../contactme.html">here</a>.
